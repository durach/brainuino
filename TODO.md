# Overview

## HARDWARE

* [.] Silent high pitch sound while display is showing numbers
* [.] Volume indicator it not linear or even logarifmic
* [.] Test if all buttons work properly
*     - No complains while playing in SG/EK mode
* [.] When connected both to USB and external power all elements not always initialize properly - solution upload firmware every time after chanigng power scheme
* [?] Make sure CN_HEADPHONES is connected after Voltage Divider

## SOFTWARE

* [?] Rename messages for tables 0..5 to T1..T6

## Maybe

* [.] Support switching mode while connecting both to 12V + USB power
* [?] Do we need SDI/I2C

# Short list plan

1. Update EasyEDA scheme to support only SMD (except Arduino Mega)
2.
